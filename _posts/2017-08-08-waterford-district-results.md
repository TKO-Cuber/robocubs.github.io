Team 1701 performed well again at the Waterford District event. At this event, we were picked first by the 7th alliance. As a member of this alliance, we upset the second seed alliance in quarterfinals and then lost in two close semifinal matches. Throughout this competition, we greatly improved our ability to manipulate gears quickly as well as speeding up our climber. Team 1701 will compete at the next Marysville event, so come back soon!
