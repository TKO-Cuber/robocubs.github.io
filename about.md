The University of Detroit Jesuit High School Robocubs build a culture within the school and throughout the city of Detroit, encouraging the development of science, technology, engineering and math. We operate with integrity and emphasize Gracious Professionalism, and strive to achieve justice in access to technology and knowledge.

## Team Outreach

The U of D Jesuit Robocubs perform outreach by working at several schools in the city of Detroit.  In addition to mentoring the middle school students in our own Academy, in 2015 we sponsored and mentored 50 students in 5th through 8th grade at Gesu Grade School and Christ the King Grade School.  Every student at Christ the King participates in a 45 minute class run by a Robocub Senior and a similar program takes place for select students at Gesu.

In 2013, 4 FLL teams, two at Gesu and two at Christ the King.  At the qualifying event at the Michigan Science Center in November, one of the Gesu teams and our own Academy placed in the top six to advance to States in Monroe in December.  In addition at the regional event, the Gesu team won 1st place in Gracious Professionalism and the Academy Robocubs won 1st place in Innovative Solution to the Project.

In 2015, we mentored 8 Robofest teams from Gesu and Christ the King.  Robofest is a competition held at Lawrence Technological University.  Four of the eight teams advanced to the state competition in May 2015.  The Robocubs also hold a Robofest Qualifying Competition annually.  This year 200 students participated at the event!
